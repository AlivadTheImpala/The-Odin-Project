    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chili is seriously one of my favorite parts of the fall-winter season.
      It's super easy to make, the leftovers are amazing, and it's incredibly
      cozy and hearty. It's basically all I want to eat from September to March.
      Our classic chili recipe is great, but I also love this simple black bean
      chili because it has a slightly lighter, brighter flavor, and I just have
      a soft spot for black beans. Gimme all the black beans all of the time! So
      if you're looking for something to meal prep for the week or just
      something to keep you warm as the air outside gets colder, give this black
      bean chili a try!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.11)</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion ($0.36)</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic ($0.32)</li>
      <li>3 15oz. cans black beans, drained ($2.37)</li>
      <li>1 10oz. can diced tomatoes with green chiles* ($1.00)</li>
      <li>1 6oz. can tomato paste ($0.99)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup basil pesto ($0.73)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp chili powder ($0.30)</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground cumin ($0.10)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano ($0.05)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt ($0.04)</li>
      <li>2 cups water ($0.00)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add the onion and garlic to a large
        pot with the olive oil and cook over medium heat just until the onions
        are softened (2-3 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground beef to the pot and continue to sauté until the beef is
        cooked through (5-7 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the drained black beans, diced tomatoes (with juices), tomato paste,
        chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, and water. Stir everything
        to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a lid on the chili and allow it to come up to a simmer. Let the
        chili simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to let the
        flavors blend and help the liquid thicken slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the chili and add salt as needed (this will depend on the salt
        content of your canned goods. I added about ½ tsp). Serve with your
        favorite chili toppings and enjoy!
      </li>
