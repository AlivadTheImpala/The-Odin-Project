    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Easy Dumpling Soup is one of my absolute favorite things to throw together
      if I want a quick-and-simple homemade lunch or an effortless dinner that's
      still wholesome, comforting, and budget-friendly. I've designed this
      recipe to be as versatile as possible, dressing up mostly store-bought
      ingredients, in order to scratch that “itch” for whatever takeout favorite
      I'm craving when ordering out isn't on the menu.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups vegetable broth* ($0.24)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce ($0.06))</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic ($0.32)</li>
      <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil ($0.06)</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp fish sauce, optional ($0.02)</li>
      <li>
        1 green onion, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated ($0.11)
      </li>
      <li>10 frozen dumplings** ($2.00)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh spinach*** ($0.15)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional Garnishes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 tsp sesame seeds ($0.03)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Sichuan Chili Crisp ($0.31)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the vegetable broth, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and the
        white parts of a sliced green onion in a medium-sized pot. (If using,
        also add the fish sauce, pre-cooked proteins or tofu, and any fresh or
        frozen vegetables that need time to soften.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the broth up to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, add the
        dumplings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot and allow the soup to come back up to a boil. Boil the
        dumplings for about 2 minutes or until they are cooked through. (Consult
        package directions.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and stir in the green parts of the sliced green onion
        and a handful of spinach.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split the soup into 2 serving bowls and top with any desired condiments.
      </li>
    </ol>
